# Kuria's Data Science Portfolio
# [Project 1: BigMart Outlet Sales Prediction](https://github.com/KuriaDan/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Big_Mart_Sales_Prediction)

* Created a model that estimates sales for an outlet of a big chain based on a datathon hosted by [Analytics Vidhya](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/#ProblemStatement)
* Did EDA and data cleaning
* Explored different methods of categorical encoding, from LabeEncoding, OneHotEncoding, mean Encoding to Catboost's implementation of the same to find the optimal way of dealing with categorical variables
* Created a baseline Catboost model That was used to gauge the performance of a more advanced approach.
* Used diverse models in creating the final model in a 1 layer stacking using SKlearn's StackingRegressor
* Averaged the models to get the best score
